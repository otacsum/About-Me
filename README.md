# hello-world

I'm a laid-back, independent, adventurer who knows how to have a good time. Whether I'm alone on the side of a mountain, enjoying a relaxing night at home, playing with my son, or enjoying a night out with friends; I live in 'the moment' and try take it all in for what its worth. I appreciate all the opportunities I've had in life and never take anything for granted. And, while it seems like I'm always doing something and rarely slow down, I work in order to LIVE - not the other way around.

I manage a team of web developers for T-Mobile USA.  We build, customize, and maintain content management systems and other custom tools used by T-Mobile front-line employees, customers, our retail partners, and our partner brands.
