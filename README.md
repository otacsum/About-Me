# About Me

I'm a laid-back, independent, adventurer who knows how to have a good time. Whether I'm alone on the side of a mountain, enjoying a relaxing night at home, working on cars with my son, or enjoying a night out with friends; I live in 'the moment' and try take it all in for what its worth. I appreciate all the opportunities I've had in life and never take anything for granted. While it seems like I'm always doing something and rarely slow down, I work in order to LIVE - not the other way around.

I'm a Sr. Software Engineer, formerly an Engineering Manager, at a Fortune 50 company.  We build, customize, and maintain content management systems and other custom applications used by front-line employees, consumers, retail partners, and our partner brands.
